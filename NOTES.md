Couple of issues noticed:

- When I switch mode, the tray icon is not automatically re-rendered so it stays in the idle color ( yellow ) some time.

- The menu item "Stop Tracking" menu item should be just under the "Current:" and maybe if possible of icon about "Stop"

- The menu item "Exit" should have a separator before it.
