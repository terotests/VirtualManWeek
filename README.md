# Virtual Man-Week

Once in my early life there was a great Windows program called "Virtual Man-Month" <sup>\*)</sup>, which was developed by a very productive programmer in our company using purely Win32 APIs at the time. It was working from the Windows tray Icon and eveyone in the company was logging their hours to it. It was a great tool which was used years in our small startup.

> \*) Named after Fred Brooks' classic book [**"The Mythical Man-Month"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), which explores the complexities of software project management and time estimation.

IMPORTANT! This tool is not yet as production grade. It uses **SQLite** database to store the data locally. So, if you use this, make backups of the data and modify the source code the way you want.

So, what this is... basicly a Windows system tray time tracker with mode switching, idle detection, and a bit of reporting, which has the main intention to track where time is "lost" in the project.

_The system tray icon showing the current time, outside the cirle showing the time worked today and hover showing the detailed summary._

So, what is going here?

1. **Database** means the main database. You must select one database and you can have several databases as _SQLite_ files. Each database could represent a customer or whatever you want.
2. **Project** is an optional metadata for each time entry. Project can have a code and a name.
3. **Mode** means what is the working intention, like "Meeting", or "Coffe break" or "Waiting for the Build" - to track how much time is spent on certain kind of activies.

Before you start tracking you need to at least select the Database and then the "Mode" of working and optionally the project, which you are working right now:

_The menu where you can switch the mode of working._

**So this is not project tracking tool** this is mostly used to track where time is spent. To find issues in the process. But you could track also the time spent on the Projects, but the most important question this tool tries to answer is "Where did the time go?".

## About

Few notes about the implementation: I am a professional programmer, but this implementation has been programmed mostly with help of **GPT-5 Preview** and **Claude Sonnet 4**. The original plan is described in the file ORIG.md, then the actual development plan before starting in the `PLAN.md`. Not all the features that were planned were implemented in the final version, for example Azure AD login.

> **DISCLAIMER** At this point I am not an experienced Python programmer so you might see some weird things in the codebase, use at own risk and make backups of the DB regularly.

## Usage

From powershell:

```
.\scripts\dev.ps1
```

This will launch the app in the dev mode, where you can also see the logs. Requires Python to be installed.

## Key Features

- üñ•Ô∏è System tray UI with visual status (green=active, yellow=idle, red=stopped)
- üò¥ Automatic idle detection and sleep/hibernate handling
- ‚úçÔ∏è Manual time entry with "Fill Idle Time" functionality
- üóÑÔ∏è Multiple database support ( SQLite )
- üìä HTML and CSV export of time entries

## Requirements

- Windows 11 (Win10 likely works)
- Python 3.11+ (for development / building)

## Quick Start (Source)

1. Clone repository
2. In repo root run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup.ps1 -Dev
   ```
3. Launch tray UI:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python -m virtualmanweek.main --tray
   ```
4. Tray icon appears (Idle = yellow, Active = green, Stopped = red). Left‚Äëclick to open menu.

## Common Actions (Tray Menu)

**Mode & Project Management:**

- Switch Mode ‚Üí [Mode List] : quickly switch to existing modes
- Switch Mode ‚Üí Edit... : open comprehensive mode management dialog
- Set Idle : manually mark current activity as idle
- Projects ‚Üí [Project List] : switch between projects
- Projects ‚Üí Edit Projects... : manage projects (add/edit/archive)

**Data Export:**

- Export ‚Üí CSV... : export time entries to CSV file
- Export ‚Üí HTML... : generate mode distribution charts and reports

**Database Management:**

- Database ‚Üí Create/Select Database : manage multiple databases
- Database ‚Üí Export/Import Database : backup and restore functionality
- Database ‚Üí Clear Logged Entries : reset data with confirmation

**Settings & Info:**

- Current database and project shown in tray tooltip and menu headers

## Troubleshooting & Logs

The application maintains detailed action logs for debugging purposes. Log files are stored in:

```
%APPDATA%\VirtualManWeek\action.log
```

The logs include:

- Session start/stop events with timestamps
- Mode switching and project changes
- Idle detection and recovery events
- Database operations and errors
- Sleep/wake detection and gap handling

To view recent log entries:

```powershell
Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\VirtualManWeek\action.log" | Select-Object -Last 20
```

Logs are automatically rotated (max 1MB per file, 5 backup files) to prevent excessive disk usage.

## Testing

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test.ps1 -Coverage   # add coverage
```
